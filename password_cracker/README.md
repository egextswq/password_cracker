# Password Cracker (Brute Force Simulator)

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates a **basic brute-force password cracking technique**, commonly found in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and penetration testing scenarios.  
Its purpose is to help students understand password vulnerabilities and how to better defend against them.

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:**  
> This tool is for **educational use only**.  
> **Do not use it on any real user accounts or systems without permission.** Illegal use can lead to severe consequences.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- How brute-force attacks function
- The impact of weak passwords
- Common password cracking strategies

## 🛠 Technologies
- Python (or insert your language)
- Dictionary files / Loops / Hashing libraries

## 🚀 Usage
1. Choose a password to simulate cracking
2. Run the script with the wordlist
3. Observe how long it takes to guess the correct one

## 🧩 Notes
- You can use your own wordlist or download common ones (e.g. rockyou.txt)
- Try comparing hashing vs plaintext checks
